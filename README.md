# Advent of Code 2023

[https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/)

This is my setup for solving this the 2023 Advent of Code problems with Node.js.  

To run a solution: 

`$ npm start <NAME-OF-SOLUTION>`

eg: `$ npm start day-1`

Note that I'm git-ignoring the input that gets generated at the AoC site. To run the tests against the real data, you'll have to sign up at Advent of Code and generate your own test input. Save it as `input.txt` in the directory of the solution you want to run.

To run tests:

`$ npm test`

If you'd like to fork this repo as a test harness for your own advent fun, feel free.  

Happy coding.
